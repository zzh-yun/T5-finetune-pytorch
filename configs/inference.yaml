# Inference configuration for T5 Chinese-English translation

# -- Model Paths --
# NOTE: Use trained checkpoint after training, not the pretrained model!
# After training, the checkpoint will be saved in SAVE_DIR/checkpoint_best.pth
model_path: /data/250010009/course/nlpAllms/project/T5_NMT/save_dir/checkpoint_best.pth # Change this to your trained checkpoint path
# If checkpoint doesn't exist, it will fall back to pretrained model (but won't work well for Chinese-English)
PRETRAINED_MODEL_PATH: '/data/250010009/course/nlpAllms/project/T5_NMT/checkpoints'  # Pretrained model directory (read-only)
SAVE_DIR: 'save_dir'  # Directory where training outputs are saved (should match train.yaml)
device: auto  # choices=['cpu', 'cuda', 'auto']
verbose: False  # Set to True to see debug information

# -- Input/Output --
input_text: "深圳是一座美丽的城市"  # A single sentence to translate
input_file: null  # Path to a text file with sentences to translate (one per line)
output_file: translations.txt
reference_file: null  # Path to the reference translations for evaluation

# -- Generation Parameters --
max_length: 128
num_beams: 4

# -- Mode --
interactive: False  # Set to True for interactive translation mode

# -- Paths --
